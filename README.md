# CS506 Project - Resume Analyzer

## Project description:
Resume Analyzer is a machine learning-based system that evaluates resumes, provides personalized feedback, and predicts the likelihood of a candidate receiving a job offer based on previous hiring patterns. Additionally in this project we also want to investigate whether there are biases in hiring decisions based on ethnicity, gender, disability, veteran status, and sexuality by analyzing historical hiring data.

By using **Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning models, and statistical analysis**, the project aims to create an actionable and ethical tool that helps job seekers **optimize their resumes** while also addressing **potential biases in the hiring process.**
